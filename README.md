# vicampo-2017

# Getting started

Step 1:

You have to setup the config-File which is not included in this project. If you use a program like XAMPP a possible setup could be:

```
define('DB_HOST', "mysql:host=localhost;");
define('DB_NAME', "dbname=vicampo");
define('DB_USER', "root");
define('DB_PASSWORD', "");
```
Now you have to store this file (config.php) in the directory "shared".

Step 2:

Then we have to create the database tables (customers, products and the relation ratings). Look at the sql-file which is filed in the project.

Step 3:

Log into the web-application with the test-user (test) and password (123).
